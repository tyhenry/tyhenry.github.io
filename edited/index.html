						<h3><span class="logo">edited.io</span> is a social platform for writers to meet and work with editors.</h3>
						<p>
							As a writer on <span class="logo">edited.io</span>, you can submit your books, articles, essays, blog posts, prose, or papers to be edited - along with a deadline, and editing style of your choosing.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Freelance editors who have passed a rigorous application process can then log in and see the writing you've uploaded. They select a text and get to work editing.  Once the editing is done, the writer is charged a fee based on the length of the text and the time taken to edit it. The editor receives the majority of this fee and <span class="logo">edited.io</span> takes a small percentage.</p>

							<h3>Behind every great writer is a great editor.</h3>
							<p>
								With the advent of self-publishing and online writing, the world is now full of text. What's gone missing are the editors. Great writers have always relied on editors to help format and clarify their prose, but without a publisher, how do you find the editor who's right for you?</p>
							<hr>
							<p>
								That's where <span class="logo">edited.io</span> comes in.  We provide an easy, safe community of writers and editors and give you the tools to find your perfect writing partner.</p>
